# SQL-Challenge-1-Danny

This is the first challenge by Danny Ma, named as Danny's Dinner: Then Taste of Success case study which aims to help Danny find out few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money theyâ€™ve spent and also which menu items are their favourite.

He plans on using these insights to help him decide whether he should expand the existing customer loyalty program - additionally he needs help to generate some basic datasets so his team can easily inspect the data without needing to use SQL.

Danny has shared with you 3 key datasets for this case study:
  sales
  menu
  members
